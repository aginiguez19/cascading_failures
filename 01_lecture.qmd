Below, you will find some recommendations for topics to discuss for your presentation on Cascading Failures. This is not an exhaustive list of topics and you are free to alter or depart from this outline depending on how you see fit. After the outline, you will find some arguments that may help in editing your `.qmd` file.

For the PSC-290 students, please proceed through the headings as if you are instructing a course. You'll be expected to discuss the mathematical formalisms of these different techniques for generating and simulating failure cascade in networks and generating considerations for what types of variable systems follow the different cascade types.

and comment on their estimation. Also, please adjust your `.qmd` file to be `week6_2.qmd` when you submit to me.

# Failures in Graphs?

Well established in this class is the fact that graphs are made up of nodes (components) and edges (links). We have many real-world examples of graphs to take from: the internet, power grids, ecology, physiology, and of course psychological systems.

In these networks often times we see the interplay of processes internal and external to the system. Think of a transmission line malfunctioning in an electrical power grid. Or possibly a perturbation to a system that disrupts communication among nodes. These two examples hint at an important dynamical process termed cascading failure or avalanche (if you're feeling fancy). Although rare, they can have severe consequences. In general, a cascading failure refers to some trigger mechanism that produces further failures in the system which ultimately may lead to a complete collapse of the system [@valdez2020jcn]. Further failures occur because components vary in their ability to handle a certain load that is redistributed to them after an initial failure.

Similarly, in social systems we might think of a cascading failure being dependent on the information other people may have and subsequently their decisions. This is quite common in fads or things that are "hyped-up". We might choose to wear Levi jeans because many of our peers are wearing Levi jeans. We might choose to see one movie over another based on reviews or recommendations by friends. Economists define these scenarios as *binary decisions with externalities*[^2]. Important to note is that a personal threshold must be reached before a transition occurs in conjunction with what others have decided. Furthermore, rather than components failing it is a component transitioning from one state to another.

Cascading failures leads us to questions such as:

-   How does the structure of a network impact its resilience to failures?

-   How can we enhance a system to mitigate further cascading failures?

-   Where are the vulnerable components in a system. Are they the high-degree or low-degree nodes?

-   When do components transition states (i.e., at a well-defined threshold)?

A group of students are running experiments and simulations in their respective labs. Suddenly a blackout occurs! Welp, there goes their precious research. Let's explain to these poor students that a cascading failure may have occurred.

1.  Overloading or zeroing of a component in the electrical power grid. *A group of Davis bikers crash into a substation*.

2.  Power is redistributed from the failed component. There is an increase in the loadings of other components.

3.  The system is stressed out and loadings are higher than the capacity of components. Leading to a cascading failure.

4.  Blackout all around Davis.

# Recap on Graph Structures

-   Focus on re-describing the Erdős–Rényi and Barabási–Albert random graphs
    -   With Barabási–Albert, talk more in-depth about preferential attachment and the "growth" of graphs
    -   E.g., graphs in the real-world add and incorporate vertices over time and the addition of vertices follows some known procedures
    -   Define the terms: Preferential attachment and Assortative mixing and how they relate to the evolution of a network's structure

# Define the CASCADE model for Cascading Failures

The CASCADE is a probabilistic model for understanding the propagation of cascading failures [@dobson2007caijons]. It was developed to capture the weakening of a system as a cascade proceeds, particularly in the context of blackout of power transmitting systems, but made sufficiently simple and general that it could be applied to cascading failure in various large, interconnected infrastructures. CASCADE focuses on components failing when their load exceeds a threshold, how an initial disturbance loads the system, and how the failure of some components transfers additional load to others.

## Formal definition of the CASCADE model:

The model considers a system with $N$ components, each with a random initial load.

1. **Initial load** ($L_j$):
  - Each component $j$ (for $j = 1, 2, ..., N$) has an initial load $L_j$.
  - The minimum value of a given load is $L^{\text{min}}$ and the maximum load is $L^{\text{max}}$.
  - $L_{j}$ is distributed uniformly between $[L^{\text{min}}, L^{\text{max}}]$.
  - The initial loads $L_{1},L_{2},...,L_{N}$ are independent of each other.

2. **Failure threshold** ($L^\text{fail}$):
  - Components fail if their total load exceeds a certain failure threshold, $L^\text{fail}$
  
3. **Load transfer** ($P$):
  - When a component fails, a fixed amount of additional load, $P$, is transferred to each of the other remaining components in the system.
  
4. **Initial disturbance** ($D$):
  - The cascade is initiated by an initial disturbance that adds an amount of load $D$ to each component.

5. **Normalized initial load**  ($\ell_{j}$):
  - The normalized initial load for the $j^{th}$ vertex is given by $\ell_{j}$ where:

$$
  \ell_{j} = \frac{L_{j} - L^{\text{min}}}{L^{\text{max}} - L^{\text{min}}}
$$
  
  - This normalization maps the load $L_j$ to a value $\ell_{j}$ that is uniformly distributed on the interval $[0,1]$.
  
6. **Normalized parameters**:
  - The load transfer $P$ and initial disturbance $D$ are also normalized. Let $p$ be the normalized load increment and $d$ be the normalized initial disturbance: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
  p = & \frac{P}{L^{\text{max}}-L^{\text{min}}} \\
  d = & \frac{D + L^{\text{max}} - L^{\text{fail}}}{L^{\text{max}}-L^{\text{min}}}
\end{aligned}
$$

7. **Cascading process**:
  - After the initial disturbance $D$, components whose total load $(L_j+D)$ exceeds $L^{\text{fail}}$ will fail.
  - The failure of these components then distributes an additional load $P$ (or $p$ in normalized terms) to other components, potentially causing further failures. This process continues iteratively, defining the cascade.

# Watt's Cascades vs. CASCADE Model

In summary, the Watt's description is more simplistic, vertices have no thresholds internal to themselves but are influenced entirely by neighbors. In the CASCADE model, vertices have resilience and an initial load such that they can exhibit more nuanced dynamics in how they fail. Let's break it down.

### Thresholds and Failure

- **Watt's model**: Failure is determined by the fraction of a node's neighbors that have already failed. A node $i$ with degree $k_i$ and threshold $\phi_i$ fails if at least $k_i \cdot \phi_i$ of its neighbors have failed. The threshold $\phi_i$ is an intrinsic property of the node, representing its susceptibility to peer influence or stress from neighbors. Vertices do not have an internal "load" capacity in the same way as the CASCADE model; their failure is purely a response to the state of their local neighborhood.

- **CASCADE**: Failure is determined by a node's internal load exceeding its predefined capacity ($L^{\text{fail}}}$). Nodes have an initial load $L_j$, and this load increases due to an initial system-wide disturbance $D$ and subsequent load transfers $P$ from other failed components. The threshold is an absolute load limit, not directly dependent on the number or state of its neighbors in the topological sense (though load transfer makes it indirectly dependent).

### Influence mechanism

- **Watt's model**: Influence is local and topological. A node is influenced directly and only by the state (failed or not) of its immediate neighbors in the graph. The structure of the network (who is connected to whom) is paramount.

- **CASCADE**:Influence is through load redistribution. When a node fails, it transfers a fixed amount of load $P$ to other components (often modeled as all other components or a subset). While the underlying network structure can be implicitly present in how loads might realistically be distributed (though the basic CASCADE model simplifies this), the primary mechanism is the global or semi-global impact of load addition.

### Vertex properties


- **Watt's model**: Vertices are primarily characterized by their degree k and their individual threshold $\phi$. There isn't an explicit concept of "resilience" beyond the threshold itself.

- **CASCADE**:Vertices are characterized by their initial load $L_j$ and a common failure load $L^{\text{fail}}$ (or a capacity derived from initial load plus a tolerance, in some variants ). The "resilience" of a node is the difference between its current load and $L^{\text{fail}}$. Nodes can have different initial loads, making some inherently closer to failure than others even before the cascade begins. This allows for more nuanced dynamics in how they fail, as a node with a high initial load is more vulnerable.

### Complexity of Dynamics

- **Watt's model**: The dynamics are driven by changes in neighbor states. The "vulnerable" nodes (low threshold relative to degree) play a crucial role in initiating widespread cascades. The model explores how network structure (especially connectivity and the clustering of vulnerable nodes) leads to different cascade regimes (power-law vs. bimodal distributions of cascade sizes).

- **CASCADE**:The dynamics are driven by accumulating load. The system's overall stress (related to how close initial loads are to Lfail and the magnitude of D and P) is a key factor. It often examines the probability distribution of the total number of failed components and how this distribution changes as system parameters (like overall loading or the load transfer $P$) approach a critical point.

### Focus

- **Watt's model**: Focuses on how local interaction rules and network topology can lead to global phenomena and explain the emergence of large, rare cascades from small shocks in social and interconnected systems more broadly.

- **CASCADE**:Often motivated by and applied to infrastructure systems like power grids, focusing on how system-wide stress and load redistribution contribute to blackout probabilities and sizes.

## Can We Know the Thresholds for Vertices?

In the CASCADE model, the threshold is essentially defined by a node's capacity and its load. In Watts' model, the threshold ($\phi$) for a node determines the fraction of its neighbors that must be "on" for it to switch "on."

-   What is a "threshold" for psychological vertices?

# Weave in Graph Structures

-   Do you expect Erdős–Rényi and Barabási–Albert random graphs to exhibit different properties in their susceptibility to cascading failures? Why?
-   For Barabási–Albert random graphs, do you expect the property of assortivity to come into play?
    -   The fact is, when real-world networks develop, they build in structural stability to be resilient to failure. Assortivity can be a tool for this. Explain.
